to select the repo to download or make changes to "git remote add origin https://github.com/DLau98/test.git"
"cd desktop" to change directory
if already in repo, "git pull" to download any changes made by other user

if you want to download the whole repo again, "git clone https://github.com/DLau98/test"

to upload changes to github make sure your directory is in the downloaded git folder "cd test"
